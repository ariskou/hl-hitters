## Abstract

In this work we focus on the problem of finding the heaviest-k and lightest-k hitters in a sliding window data stream. 
We propose a novel algorithm which for the first time, to our knowledge, provides exact, not approximate, results while at the same time achieves O(1) time with high probability complexity on both update and query operations.
